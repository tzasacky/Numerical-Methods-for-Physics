# Numerical-Methods-for-Physics

This is a set of MATLAB functions I created for various numerical techniques of use in math&physics. 

This was my first introduction to programming, and what made me want to study computer science! :) 

Given that, the code style may be somewhat rudimentary, as I have not cleaned it up ex-post-facto.
